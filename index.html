<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>

<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make non-atomic feature changes to the codebase or refactor
substanial site content or design</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add an atomic feature or redesign one part of the
content or style of the site</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make bug fixes, changes which do not add new
functionality but repairs broken functionality.</li>
</ol><p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>

<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Tom Preston-Warner developed the formal definition of Semantic Versioning some
time ago, and it was great. It formalized much of what software developers do
on a regular basis and provides version numbers that hold semantic value. That
is, at a glance you can tell what relationship v2.1.22 has to v1.5.0 or
v3.2.1.</p>

<p>The world rejoiced.</p>

<p>There is one oversight in this methodology. Not all codebases involve public
APIs, a precondition for TPW's Semantic Versioning. Given this restriction, we
have developed an alternate version of Semantic Versioning which we call
Content-based Semantic Versioning.</p>

<p>In this world, your codebase versions are not dictated intrinsically by breaking
or adding features to public APIs. Rather, they are determined by whether a
feature inovlves non-atomic or atomic feature changes. Patch level versions
remain the same. I'll admit, there's more room for interpretation in a project
under CBSV, even TPW admitted that under traditional SV one must be ever
vigilant about codebase changes and such.</p>

<p>One final caveat, CBSV was created primarly to manage content-heavy website
codebases. Thus, most of this document is nearly identical to the original but
instead of a public API, the goal of versions is to manage changes to the
content structure and, in the case of websites, URL structure.</p>

<h2>
<a name="semantic-versioning-specification-semver" class="anchor" href="#semantic-versioning-specification-semver"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)</h2>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Software using API-less Semantic Versioning MUST declare a content
structure. This content structure can be extrapolated from the code or
documented outside the code. However it is done, it should be precise and
comprehensive.</p></li>
<li><p>A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are
non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the
major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version.
Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -&gt; 1.10.0 -&gt; 1.11.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.</p></li>
<li><p>Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change
at any time. The content structure should not be considered stable.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 1.0.0 defines the content structure. The way in which the version number
is incremented after this release is dependent on this content structure and how it
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards
compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal
change that fixes incorrect behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if new, atomic
changes to contect structure or URLs is introduced to the codebase. It MUST be
incremented if any atomic funcationality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be
incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced
within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version
MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.</p></li>
<li><p>Major version X (X.y.z | X &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if any non-atomic
changes to content structure or URLs is introduced to the codebase. It MAY
also include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be 
reset to 0 when major version is incremented.</p></li>
<li><p>A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a
series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch
version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen
[0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST
NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower
precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version
indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the
intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated
normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7,
1.0.0-x.7.z.92.</p></li>
<li><p>Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot
separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version.
Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-].
Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining
version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata,
have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700,
1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.</p></li>
<li><p>Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.
Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch
and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure
into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference when
comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor,
and patch versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 &lt; 2.0.0 &lt;
2.1.0 &lt; 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has
lower precedence than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0. Precedence
for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST
be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right
until a difference is found as follows: identifiers consisting of only digits
are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared
lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence
than non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher
precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.
Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.1 &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.beta &lt; 1.0.0-beta &lt;
1.0.0-beta.2 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.11 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1 &lt; 1.0.0.</p></li>

<h2>
<a name="why-use-semantic-versioning" class="anchor" href="#why-use-semantic-versioning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Use Semantic Versioning?</h2>

<p>This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do something
close to this already. The problem is that "close" isn't good enough. Without
compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are
essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear
definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions
to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but
not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.</p>

<p>A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency
hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called "Firetruck." It requires a
Semantically Versioned package named "Ladder." At the time that Firetruck is
created, Ladder is at version 3.1.0. Since Firetruck uses some functionality
that was first introduced in 3.1.0, you can safely specify the Ladder
dependency as greater than or equal to 3.1.0 but less than 4.0.0. Now, when
Ladder version 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 become available, you can release them to your
package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing
dependent software.</p>

<p>As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any
package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place;
there's nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let
Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade
packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you
time and hassle.</p>

<p>If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic
Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link
to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from
them.</p>

<p>The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0
and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.</p>
