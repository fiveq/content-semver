{"name":"Content-Semver","tagline":"Content-based Semantic Versioning Specification","body":"In the beginning, there was regular Semantic Versioning. But it included a\r\nwhole bunch of stuff about public APIs that a great many projects we work on at\r\nour agency do not have. Left with a choice of making a pinky swear with each\r\nnew developer we hired, or simply wordsmithing Tom Preston-Warner's great idea\r\ninto something we could reference internally, we went the latter route.\r\n\r\nBenefits to writing things down:\r\n\r\n  1. Reference for old salts\r\n  2. Reference for new hires\r\n  3. Reference to settle drinking bets\r\n  4. Sanity in versioning complex content-based projects\r\n\r\nDownsides to writing things down:\r\n\r\n  1. Now there's a *right way* to do it :(\r\n  2. No more B/S'ing your way through an off-schedule production deployment\r\n  3. More reading\r\n\r\nBut seriously, the biggest change to this document from version 2.0.0 of\r\n[semver](http://github.com/mojombo/semver) is that we distinguish the reasons\r\nfor minor and major iterations using atomic or non-atomic feature additions to\r\nthe content and URL structure of the project.\r\n\r\nExampli gratia\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYou're at v1.2.10 of a website's codebase. The client asks you to allow the\r\ndonation form to accept payments via Stripe instead of Auth.net. \r\n\r\nThis would be part of a v1.3 release.\r\n\r\nIt qualifies as a substantial feature addition, but is atomic, i.e. does not\r\nchange ay other aspect of the site or the URL patterns.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe current site, v1.1.30 targets Django v1.4, but we are quickly leaving the\r\nmaintenance period of this release. Your work to bring the site up to date with\r\nthe latest Django release will likely touch a number of components and require\r\nupdating 3rd-party library versions as well.\r\n\r\nThis would be part of a v2.0.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe changes introduced by the upgrade are non-atmoic, i.e. they touch many\r\nparts of the codebase and could lead to functional changes, as newer version of\r\nDjango may deprecate things like generic function-based views.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou're at v1.4.0 and the client notes that the registration form you just added\r\nas part of v1.4 isn't working as expected. People try to sign up for the free\r\nsundae party and are instead being cross-registered for the hot dog eating\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nThis would be part of a v1.4.1 release.\r\n\r\nHopefully you'd have a few more patches to wrap up in that release but if\r\nthat's the only one, that's okay too.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
